Python Script
In Python, you can use the ipaddress module which provides a straightforward way to handle IP addresses. Hereâ€™s a Python script to sort IP addresses:

import ipaddress

def sort_ip_addresses(ip_list):
    # Convert IP addresses to IP objects, sort them, and convert them back to strings
    sorted_ips = sorted(ipaddress.ip_address(ip) for ip in ip_list)
    return [str(ip) for ip in sorted_ips]

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Sample IP addresses
    ip_addresses = [
        "192.168.1.1",
        "10.0.0.1",
        "172.16.0.1",
        "192.168.1.10",
        "10.0.0.2",
    ]

    sorted_ips = sort_ip_addresses(ip_addresses)
    print("Sorted IP addresses:")
    for ip in sorted_ips:
        print(ip)




Explanation
ipaddress.ip_address: Converts a string IP address into an IPv4Address or IPv6Address object.
sorted: Sorts the IP address objects.
str: Converts IP address objects back into strings.


Python Script: Save it as sort_ips.py, and run it using python sort_ips.py.
