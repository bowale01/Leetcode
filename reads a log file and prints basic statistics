For this example, let's assume log entries have a format like this:
[2024-07-30 12:00:00] INFO Some log message here
[2024-07-30 12:01:00] ERROR Another log message here

def read_log_file_and_print_statistics(file_path):
    """
    Reads a log file and prints basic statistics.

    :param file_path: Path to the log file.
    """
    import collections
    
    try:
        # Dictionary to hold log levels and their counts
        log_levels = collections.defaultdict(int)
        
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            total_lines = 0
            
            for line in file:
                total_lines += 1
                if line.strip():  # Check if the line is not empty
                    # Assuming log level is between brackets like [INFO] or [ERROR]
                    parts = line.split()
                    if len(parts) > 1:
                        log_level = parts[1]
                        log_levels[log_level] += 1
        
        # Print statistics
        print(f"Total number of lines: {total_lines}")
        print(f"Number of unique log levels: {len(log_levels)}")
        for level, count in log_levels.items():
            print(f"Log level '{level}': {count} occurrences")
    
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file {file_path} was not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage:
# read_log_file_and_print_statistics('path_to_log_file.log')


Explanation
Import Collections: The collections.defaultdict is used to simplify counting log levels.

Open and Read File: The file is opened in read mode. Each line is processed to count total lines and occurrences of each log level.

Line Processing: Each line is split, and the log level (assumed to be the second element) is counted.

Error Handling: Handles cases where the file does not exist or other potential errors.

Print Statistics: Outputs the total number of lines, unique log levels, and counts for each log level.

Notes
Log Format: Ensure the log format matches the assumed format. Modify the parsing logic if the format is different.
Performance: This approach reads the file line-by-line, making it memory efficient for large files.
Extensibility: You can extend the function to include more sophisticated statistics, such as timestamp ranges, error frequencies, etc., based on your needs.
Feel free to modify the function according to your specific log file format and requirements!
