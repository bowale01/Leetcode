ash Script
You can use a Bash script to perform the calculations. Here’s a simple script to estimate the number of golf balls:


#!/bin/bash

# Dimensions of the school bus in inches
length_in = 480
width_in = 96
height_in = 72

# Volume of the bus
volume_bus=$(echo "$length_in * $width_in * $height_in" | bc)

# Diameter and radius of the golf ball in inches
diameter_ball=1.68
radius_ball=$(echo "$diameter_ball / 2" | bc)

# Volume of a golf ball
volume_ball=$(echo "scale=4; (4 / 3) * 4 * a(1) * ($radius_ball^3)" | bc -l)

# Packing efficiency (74% for spheres)
packing_efficiency=0.74

# Effective volume available for golf balls
effective_volume=$(echo "$volume_bus * $packing_efficiency" | bc)

# Number of golf balls
num_balls=$(echo "scale=0; $effective_volume / $volume_ball" | bc)

echo "Number of golf balls that fit in a school bus: $num_balls"



Python Script
You can use Python to perform the same calculations. Here’s a simple Python script for it:

import math

# Dimensions of the school bus in inches
length_in = 480
width_in = 96
height_in = 72

# Volume of the bus
volume_bus = length_in * width_in * height_in

# Diameter and radius of the golf ball in inches
diameter_ball = 1.68
radius_ball = diameter_ball / 2

# Volume of a golf ball (using the formula for the volume of a sphere)
volume_ball = (4 / 3) * math.pi * (radius_ball ** 3)

# Packing efficiency (74% for spheres)
packing_efficiency = 0.74

# Effective volume available for golf balls
effective_volume = volume_bus * packing_efficiency

# Number of golf balls
num_balls = effective_volume / volume_ball

print(f"Number of golf balls that fit in a school bus: {int(num_balls)}")


Bash Script:

Calculates the volume of the bus and golf ball.
Uses bc for arbitrary-precision calculations.
Accounts for packing efficiency.
Computes the number of golf balls that fit into the bus.
Python Script:

Performs similar calculations using Python’s math module for π.
Uses floating-point arithmetic to handle precision.
Prints the number of golf balls that fit into the bus.
