1. Using awk, sort, and uniq
Extracts the IP addresses, sorts them, and then removes duplicates.

cat file.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq



2. Using awk with sort and uniq Directly
Combines extraction and processing of IP addresses in a single pipeline:

awk '{print $1}' file.log | sort | uniq


3. Using grep, sort, and uniq
Extracts IP addresses using a regex pattern, then sorts and removes duplicates.

grep -oP '\b\d{1,3}(\.\d{1,3}){3}\b' file.log | sort | uniq


4. Using grep with awk and sort
Filters lines with grep, extracts IPs with awk, and then sorts and removes duplicates:

grep -oP '\b\d{1,3}(\.\d{1,3}){3}\b' file.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq



5. Using sed and sort
Extracts IP addresses with sed, then sorts and finds unique values:

sed -n 's/^\([0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\).*/\1/p' file.log | sort | uniq



6. Using awk with Associative Arrays
An advanced method to directly extract and store unique IP addresses:

awk '{ip[$1]++} END {for (i in ip) print i}' file.log



7. Using cut, sort, and uniq
Extracts the first field, sorts it, and removes duplicates:


cut -d' ' -f1 file.log | sort | uniq



Explanation of Each Approach:

1.  awk, sort, and uniq:

awk '{print $1}': Extracts the first field (assumed to be the IP address).
sort: Orders the IP addresses.
uniq: Removes duplicate IP addresses.


2. grep, sort, and uniq:

grep -oP '\b\d{1,3}(\.\d{1,3}){3}\b': Extracts IP addresses using a regex pattern.
sort and uniq: Used to sort and get unique IP addresses.


3. sed:

sed -n 's/^\([0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\).*/\1/p': Extracts IP addresses using regex and pattern replacement.


4. cut:

cut -d' ' -f1: Splits the file into fields using a delimiter (space) and extracts the first field.


5.  awk with Associative Arrays:

awk '{ip[$1]++} END {for (i in ip) print i}': Uses associative arrays to store unique IP addresses and prints them.
Each method has its use case depending on the structure of your log file and your preferences for processing and extracting data.
